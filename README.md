Solidity Course from Free Code Camp

As I progress through this course I will be saving my projects here

Here are some resources for learning Solidity:

I am learning blockchain development as my new career and have gathered together the resources I’m using to learn. I haven’t used all of them yet, but I have looked through them and they look good, with varying relevance for what you want to do. Change is fast in crypto, so their usefulness will likely fade over time. Cryptozombies for example is a few years old and uses an old version of solidity but it is still helpful. For me it showed some of the possibilities with solidity and helped me get familiar with the syntax and vocabulary of solidity.

Currently I’m working my way through the 30 hour video course from freecodecamp. I really recommend it. He walks you through coding contracts in a really applied way without skipping any important steps. A few hours in and I was already running my own contracts on an ethereum testnet.

I’m also reading the book Mastering Blockchain when I only have my kindle around and it is very in depth from the bottom of the stack up, explaining cryptography, consensus, blockchains, and so on. It has tons of inline source references for more information, especially useful in the ebook version.

I’ll give more recommendations as I progress through this journey.
